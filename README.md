# 42_printf
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :)

## Challenges
The biggests challenges in ft_printf recode function, in my opinion, are three:

### 1. Understanding variadic functions (functions that receives an variable number of arguments);

### 2 . Understanding stdarg.h library, create structs witch contains pointers to the arguments received, and implement the logic depending in each kind of variable argument type;

### 3 . Last but not least, understand about conversion, flags, width precision and cspdiuxX%.

## I created a board to help undestanding

## Most important steps

### Read printf3 manual;

### Organize your schedule;

### Test a LOT!

### Deal with Makefile integration with Libft!
